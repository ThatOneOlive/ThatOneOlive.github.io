        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hey! My name is Christian Fontenot, and I'm a college student going for computer science. As a child I was into video games, 
        and that slowly transformed into an interest in computers in general. The first programming language that I got any real experience in was Python, when I 
        took an intro class in high school. From there I've progressed from my inefficient python skills to C++, and Java. By the end of high school I had gotten
        more serious about computer science in general, and decided it was what I wanted to do as a career.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In college I've mostly continued with C++ for courses and other projects,
        but in my spare time I've picked up other languages such as Ruby and C#. I'm always interested in learning new things, such as technologies and languages,
        and seek to always be improving my own knowledge.</p>
