          <p>My name is Christian Fontenot, and I'm a university student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and a Bachelor's in Mathematics. From a young age I was interested in computers, and now I am turning that passion into a career. I'm particularly interested in programming language and compiler design and optimization, and involved theory. My goal post undergraduate studies is to pursue a doctorate in Computer Science, and contribute to research in furthering the field, and advancing what is possible. More specifically, my interests in research are primarily on how we can extend type systems for improved security, optimizations, and parallelism.</p>
	  <p>I'm also passionate about lower level programming, at a systems, os, or embedded level, especially around interaction with hardware. To this end, I'm interested in robotics engineering, my minor, and how we can use software to interaqct with the physical world to solve challenging issues. I enjoy tinkering with microcontrollers and hardware, currently having an Arduino Uno, an STM32 Nucleo, and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
	  <p> Overall, I'm passionate about learning. There's so much to learn, and I believe that this doesn't stop once a degree is earned. By constantly learning, I'm able to gain new insight and look at problems in a new light, and this seems to be one of the keys to successful engineering. </p>
